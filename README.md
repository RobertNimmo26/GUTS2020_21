# Cat Mapper - Do You Have the GUTS 2020 21

The app allows you to find cats nearby during your daily lockdown walks. 

## Overview

Are you trying to add some excitement in your daily lockdown walk? When reading the challenge SAS about improving lives during lockdown, we taught about helping all the cat lovers out there find a cat.


## Features

When the users open the app they are asked to enable their location through the GPS. When enabled, the map centers around their location.  Recent cats that have been reported by other users are displayed as heatmap points in the map. The user can then walk to the closer cat or the most recent cat seen. When the users find  new cats, they can press the button “Found a cat” and the heatmap will be updated with the new entry. A pop-up window will come up as well after pressing that button, asking for details of the cat that will be stored in the database. 

## Technologies

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)

- [React Native Paper, UI library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)

- [Google Maps API](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/google/)

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs)

## What We Learnt

We were all new to React Native and all the technologies listed above. It was a challenge to get the app running on all the local machines, but once it has been done, using expo made things easier to see instant changes. 

## Future improvements 

The app can be improved by adding a feature of lost cats. Users can upload pictures of the cats they have lost. Those who look for cats  can also go on the lost cats tab and swipe yes or no to say if the cat they saw corresponds to the lost one.
